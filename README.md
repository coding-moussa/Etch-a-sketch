# Etch-a-sketch

This project was created by Hisham Moussa from project instructions in The-Odin-Project foundations course.

The goal of this first part of the project is for me to create a Etch - A - Sketch game from scratch. The instructions were to create the game using Javascript and the DOM module and not by html. The instructions for this project can be found at https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch.


By creating the first part of this project I have practiced using Javascript and the DOM module to make changes to my html and CSS styles. 

I have learned how to use event listeners, for each loops, for loops, and css grids.




Still needs to be completed:

1. create a grid that the user play with on launch of site 
2. Limit the prompts input to a maximum of 100
3. Make the prompts only accept numbers, and only numbers below 100. If a NaN or a number > 100 is inputted than re-run the prompt.
